1. Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each

<!-- Static Position: -->

The default position value for elements.
Elements with static positioning are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, right, or z-index properties.

Code example:

.static-position {
    position: static;
  }
  
  <!-- Fixed Position -->
  Elements with fixed positioning are positioned relative to the viewport.
They do not scroll with the page and remain fixed at the specified position.

Code example:
.fixed-position {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    right: 30px;
  }

  
  <!-- Sticky Position: -->

  Elements with sticky positioning are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
They behave like relative positioning until a specified scroll threshold is reached.
At that point, they "stick" to the specified position and remain fixed.


Code example:

.sticky-position {
    position: sticky;
    top: 50px;
  }
  
  <!-- Relative Position: -->

  Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
The top, bottom, left, and right properties can be used to adjust their position.

Code example:

.relative-position {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    left: 20px;
  }
  

  <!-- Absolute Position: -->

  Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no ancestor has a positioned property.
They are taken out of the normal document flow and do not leave a gap in the layout.

Code example:

.absolute-position {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
  }
